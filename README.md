# Nostr MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides Nostr capabilities to LLMs like Claude.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d2d47d0-c61b-44e2-85be-5985d2a81c64

## Features

This server implements several tools for interacting with the Nostr network:

1. `getProfile`: Fetches a user's profile information by public key
2. `getKind1Notes`: Fetches text notes (kind 1) authored by a user
3. `getKind30078Notes`: Fetches Application Specific Data (kind 30078) authored by a user
4. `getLongFormNotes`: Fetches long-form content (kind 30023) authored by a user
5. `getReceivedZaps`: Fetches zaps received by a user, including detailed payment information
6. `getSentZaps`: Fetches zaps sent by a user, including detailed payment information
   7 `getAllZaps`: Fetches both sent and received zaps for a user, clearly labeled with direction and totals
7. `searchNips`: Search through Nostr Implementation Possibilities (NIPs) with relevance scoring
8. `sendAnonymousZap`: Prepare an anonymous zap to a profile or event, generating a lightning invoice for payment

All tools fully support both hex public keys and npub format, with user-friendly display of Nostr identifiers.

## Usage in Claude

Once configured, you can ask Claude to use the Nostr tools by making requests like:

- "Show me the profile information for npub1qny3tkh0acurzla8x3zy4nhrjz5zd8ne6dvrjehx9n9hr3lnj08qwuzwc8"
- "What are the recent posts from npub1qny3tkh0acurzla8x3zy4nhrjz5zd8ne6dvrjehx9n9hr3lnj08qwuzwc8?"
- "Show me recent posts from npub1qny3tkh0acurzla8x3zy4nhrjz5zd8ne6dvrjehx9n9hr3lnj08qwuzwc8 with kind 30078"
- "Show me the long-form articles from npub1qny3tkh0acurzla8x3zy4nhrjz5zd8ne6dvrjehx9n9hr3lnj08qwuzwc8"
- "How many zaps has npub1qny3tkh0acurzla8x3zy4nhrjz5zd8ne6dvrjehx9n9hr3lnj08qwuzwc8 received?"
- "Show me the zaps sent by npub1qny3tkh0acurzla8x3zy4nhrjz5zd8ne6dvrjehx9n9hr3lnj08qwuzwc8"
- "Show me all zaps (both sent and received) for npub1qny3tkh0acurzla8x3zy4nhrjz5zd8ne6dvrjehx9n9hr3lnj08qwuzwc8"
- "Search for NIPs about zaps"
- "What NIPs are related to long-form content?"
- "Show me NIP-23 with full content"
- "Send an anonymous zap of 100 sats to npub1qny3tkh0acurzla8x3zy4nhrjz5zd8ne6dvrjehx9n9hr3lnj08qwuzwc8"
- "Send 1000 sats to note1abcdef... with a comment saying 'Great post!'"

The server automatically handles conversion between npub and hex formats, so you can use either format in your queries. Results are displayed with user-friendly npub identifiers.

## Advanced Usage

You can specify custom relays for any query:

- "Show me the profile for npub1qny3tkh0acurzla8x3zy4nhrjz5zd8ne6dvrjehx9n9hr3lnj08qwuzwc8 using relay wss://relay.damus.io"

You can also specify the number of notes or zaps to fetch:

- "Show me the latest 20 notes from npub1qny3tkh0acurzla8x3zy4nhrjz5zd8ne6dvrjehx9n9hr3lnj08qwuzwc8"

For anonymous zaps, you can include optional comments and specify the target type:

- "Send an anonymous zap of 500 sats to note1abcdef... with the comment 'Great post!'"
- "Send 1000 sats anonymously to nevent1qys... using relay wss://relay.damus.io"

For zap queries, you can enable extra validation and debugging:

- "Show me all zaps for npub1qny3tkh0acurzla8x3zy4nhrjz5zd8ne6dvrjehx9n9hr3lnj08qwuzwc8 with validation and debug enabled"

For NIP searches, you can control the number of results and include full content:

- "Search for NIPs about zaps with full content"
- "Show me the top 5 NIPs about relays"
- "What NIPs are related to encryption? Show me 15 results"

## Limitations

- The server has a default 8-second timeout for queries to prevent hanging
- Only public keys in hex format or npub format are supported
- Only a subset of relays is used by default

## Implementation Details

- Native support for npub format using NIP-19 encoding/decoding
- NIP-57 compliant zap receipt detection with direction-awareness (sent/received/self)
- Advanced bolt11 invoice parsing with payment amount extraction
- Smart caching system for improved performance with large volumes of zaps
- Total sats calculations for sent/received/self zaps with net balance
- Optional NIP-57 validation for ensuring zap receipt integrity
- Anonymous zap support with lightning invoice generation
- Support for zapping profiles, events (note IDs), and replaceable events (naddr)
- Each tool call creates a fresh connection to the relays, ensuring reliable data retrieval

## Anonymous Zaps

The `sendAnonymousZap` tool lets users send zaps without revealing their Nostr identity. Key points about anonymous zaps:

- The zap will appear to come from an anonymous user in the recipient's wallet
- The zap follows the NIP-57 protocol but without a sender signature
- The recipient can still receive the payment and any included message
- You can zap profiles (using npub/hex pubkey), specific events (using note/nevent/hex ID), or replaceable events (using naddr)
- The server generates a lightning invoice for payment that you can copy into your Lightning wallet

Examples:

```
"Send an anonymous zap of 100 sats to npub1qny3tkh0acurzla8x3zy4nhrjz5zd8ne6dvrjehx9n9hr3lnj08qwuzwc8"
"Send 1000 sats anonymously to note1abcdef... with the comment 'Great post!'"
```

The server fully validates LNURL services according to LNURL-pay (LUD-06) and Lightning Address (LUD-16) specifications, ensuring compatibility with various wallet implementations.

## Troubleshooting

- If queries time out, try increasing the `QUERY_TIMEOUT` value in the source code (currently 8 seconds)
- If no data is found, try specifying different relays that might have the data
- Check Claude's MCP logs for detailed error information

## Default Relays

The server uses the following relays by default:

- wss://relay.damus.io
- wss://relay.nostr.band
- wss://relay.primal.net
- wss://nos.lol
- wss://relay.current.fyi
- wss://nostr.bitcoiner.social

## Development

To modify or extend this server:

1. Edit the relevant file:

   - `index.ts`: Main server and tool registration
   - `note/note-tools.ts`: Profile and notes functionality ([Documentation](./note/README.md))
   - `zap/zap-tools.ts`: Zap-related functionality ([Documentation](./zap/README.md))
   - `nips/nips-tools.ts`: Functions for searching NIPs ([Documentation](./nips/README.md))
   - `utils/`: Shared utility functions
     - `constants.ts`: Global constants and relay configurations
     - `conversion.ts`: Pubkey format conversion utilities
     - `formatting.ts`: Output formatting helpers
     - `pool.ts`: Nostr connection pool management
     - `ephemeral-relay.ts`: In-memory Nostr relay for testing

2. Run `npm run build` to compile

3. Restart Claude for Desktop or Cursor to pick up your changes

## Testing

We've implemented a comprehensive test suite using Jest to test both basic functionality and integration with the Nostr protocol:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run a specific test file
npm test -- __tests__/basic.test.ts

# Run integration tests
npm test -- __tests__/integration.test.ts
```

The test suite includes:

### Unit Tests

- `basic.test.ts` - Tests simple profile formatting and zap receipt processing
- `profile-notes-simple.test.ts` - Tests profile and note data structures
- `zap-tools-simple.test.ts` - Tests zap processing and anonymous zap preparation

### Integration Tests

- `integration.test.ts` - Tests interaction with an ephemeral Nostr relay including:

  - Publishing profile events
  - Creating and retrieving text notes
  - Publishing zap receipts
  - Filtering events

- `websocket-integration.test.ts` - Tests WebSocket communication with a Nostr relay:
  - Publishing events over WebSocket
  - Subscribing to events with filters
  - Managing multiple subscriptions
  - Closing subscriptions
  - Verifying that events with invalid signatures are rejected

All integration tests use our `ephemeral-relay.ts` implementationâ€”a fully functional in-memory Nostr relay that supports the Nostr protocol, allowing for real cryptographic event signing and verification without requiring external network connections. This provides a robust way to test the full Nostr workflow in an isolated environment.

For more details about the test suite, see [**tests**/README.md](./__tests__/README.md).

## Codebase Organization

The codebase is organized into modules:

- Core server setup in `index.ts`
- Specialized functionality in dedicated directories:
  - [`nips/`](./nips/README.md): NIPs search and caching functionality
  - [`note/`](./note/README.md): Profile and notes functionality
  - [`zap/`](./zap/README.md): Zap handling and anonymous zapping
- Common utilities in the `utils/` directory

This modular structure makes the codebase more maintainable, reduces duplication, and enables easier feature extensions. For detailed information about each module's features and implementation, see their respective documentation.
